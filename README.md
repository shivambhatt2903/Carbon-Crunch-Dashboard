# 🌍 Company Emission Produced Analysis

## 📌 Introduction
This project analyzes the emissions produced by companies during their production processes. The goal is to identify companies with high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and assess their sustainability efforts. By examining key environmental factors such as energy consumption, waste generation, and carbon footprint, this analysis highlights companies that need to focus more on sustainable development to minimize their environmental impact.

## 🎯 Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to analyze emissions data and identify companies that lack sustainability initiatives. By uncovering these insights, the project aims to encourage organizations to adopt eco-friendly practices and contribute to environmental protection.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **🏭 Facility ID** – Unique identifier for the facility
- **🏢 Facility Name** – Name of the company facility
- **🔍 Scope** – Scope of emissions (Scope 1, Scope 2, or Scope 3)
- **🌫️ GHG Type** – Type of greenhouse gas emitted
- **📉 Emissions (tons)** – Total emissions in tons
- **⚙️ Production Volume (units)** – Number of production units
- **🔋 Energy Consumption (MWh)** – Energy used in megawatt-hours
- **♻️ Waste (tons)** – Waste generated in tons
- **📅 Quarters** – Quarter of the year
- **📆 Year** – Year of data collection
- **💰 Income Distribution** – Financial data related to emission trends
- **🚚 Supplier** – Supplier-related emissions
- **🌍 Estimated Carbon Footprint (tons CO₂e)** – Estimated total carbon footprint

## 🎯 Objectives
